# The different weekly earnings between black and not black people
<b>Aim:</b> <br>To investigate whether race influences weekly earnings
<br><br>
<b>Background:</b> <br> There is different race in the world. This project would like to investigate whether race affects 
weekly earnings. The dataset ex1029 in the Sleuth3 package of R studio are used in this project for 
the investigation. The dataset includes the following personal information: weekly earnings in $, 
region (Midwest, Northeast, South, or West), Metropolitan Status (Whether a person live in a 
metropolitan area), year of experience, year of education, race (whether a person is Black). There are 
25437 sample in the dataset, 1978 are black people and 23459 are not.
<br><br>
<b>Findings:</b> <br> The weekly earnings of not black people are 1.264 times more than black people.
<br><br>
<b>Discussion:</b> <br> The estimate of not black people is 2.352e-01 (Table 3), this helps the project to calculate the 
difference of weekly earning between not black and black people, which not black people are 1.264 
times more than black people. 63 years of experience is not usual, so this outlier is removed. Log 
transformation can help this project. Figure 5 shows in the metropolitan area, with less than seven 
years of education, black and not black people have the similar weekly earning, with more than 
seven years of education, not black people have more weekly earning than black people. In the not 
metropolitan area, with the same education, not black people have more weekly earnings than not 
black people.
